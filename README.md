A spatial cognition-driven transmission model of infectious diseases
## General framework
The overall framework of the model for simulating the spatiotemporal spread process of epidemics at the urban scale is shown in Fig. 1. The model is mainly divided into three parts, which are used to generate urban simulation scenarios, express behavior interactions at the individual and group levels, and describe the dynamics of infectious disease transmission. Firstly, a complete urban system is essentially composed of various elements such as transportation, space, economy, society, and environment (E. J. Miller et al. 2004). This model integrates these elements according to the simulation target into two major categories: synthetic urban population (including age structure, social relations, etc.) and natural urban environment (including land use types, transportation networks, etc.). These two together constitute the urban scenario for simulation, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The second part mainly models human behavior in cities at the individual and group levels, as shown in Fig. 1(b).
Discretizing time, space, and behavior is a prerequisite for simulating human behavior. On this basis, the Urban-EPR model, which is an extension and modification of the Exploration and Preferential Return model(EPR) (Song, Koren, et al. 2010; Schläpfer et al. 2021; Nie et al. 2022), can effectively express the mobility behavior logic of human individuals with spatial cognitive abilities in urban systems. The construction of the group spatial interaction model further describes social interactions and mobility behaviors occurring inside and outside the region from a micro-macro perspective. Finally, by coupling the infectious disease transmission dynamics model, the model is equipped with the ability to simulate the virus spread process in cities, as shown in Fig. 1(c).
